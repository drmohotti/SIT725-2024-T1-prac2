Save the server.js file.

Run your server by executing node server.js in the terminal.

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your simple web page served by the Node.js server.

To access the simple endpoint, navigate to http://localhost:3000/api/message in your browser.

That's it! You've created a simple web server using Node.js and Express, served a static web page from a public folder, and created a simple endpoint. You can further expand and customize this setup as needed.
